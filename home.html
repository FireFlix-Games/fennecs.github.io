    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    <p id="BasicInfoP1">The <b>fennec fox</b>
    is a small crepuscular fox native to the Sahara Desert and the Sinai Peninsula. <br /> 
    Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate heat. 
    <br /> The fennec is the smallest canid species. <br />
    Fennec Foxes are sometimes called <b>"desert foxes"</b> because they live in desert zones of North Africa and the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas. </p>
